The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting.

I use a lot of content creating apps and websites and this machine has not gotten hot once! Really one of the best purchases I've made especially in the computer space. I usually keep laptops for 6+ years and I do not see that changing with this one. However, there are a couple of drawbacks, if you need MS Access then you will need to use an emulator to run Windows on the laptop (Parallels does an awesome job of that) and some web file hosting applications still don't work for M1 laptops like Box.

23,23,"2021 Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, Apple M1 Pro chip with 8‑core CPU and 14‑core GPU, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) - Space Gray",Best MacBook Pro ever - for a lot of reasons,"M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks.",Jake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2021",348 people found this helpful

That laptop still today is in great working order for what it is, I find that quite amazing since most of the PC products of recent are junk, designed to last less than one year. You may think me biased, but I'm not, just read the competitor's reviews for yourself which I did extensively before buying my next Macbook Pro. I used to be a Windows user, and still am, but not on a Windows based system with Intel silicon. Those systems are unstable, more hackable, and the hardware that is made even from manufacturers like HP today do not live up to the standards they lived up to in the past. Reading most of the different Apple product reviews, the biggest complaint was price. Well, the old adage still applies, you basically get what you pay for and I was thrilled to wait it out for their September event when I saw this going for $400 off at $1599!. Regarding all the hyperbole about the notch, I honestly do not know it is even there. As far as this new Macbook Pro 14"" is concerned, well I cannot express how beautiful this laptop is. The display and sound are to die for, the speed of the m1 silicon is amazing. Yes, it's a little heavier than my previous Macbook Air 13, but the body of the Pro is actually a smaller footprint than it's predecessor, but with a larger display!

The temperature on this thing averages over 80 degrees, which means this thing isn't built to last. It is very powerful and plays everything at 60 fps on Ultra, but it gets really hot (gets close to 100 degrees when gaming). I have a laptop fan running on high underneath this laptop and it still gets really hot. I even use it next to a portable ac blowing into it. Nothing helps keep it cool. In essence, yes, it's powerful, but trying to keep this thing under 80 degrees is a huge problem that will result in parts failure within a year; heck, even within 6 months. The battery life is terrible (2 hours on average). When you plug it in, that's when you have full power of the GPU or graphics card. When unplugged (using battery), the gpu runs half powered and is cooler, but with a 2 hour battery life, you have to constantly plug it in to use it. Most laptops I've owned have lasted over 2 years, but this particular one doesn't seem likely to even make it to a year with its heating issues. Considering the cost, it's better to game on desktop as you have more control/options for cooling than a pre-built powerhouse laptop.",Sometimes Blue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2022",

La calidad de materiales y ensamble es correcto (no es un PC premium, pero no se espera que lo sea por ese precio); su rendimiento es muy bueno, corre lo que sea. La temperatura del procesador y la grafica es muy buena cuando juegas; por ejemplo, warzone en graficos altos, no pasa de 78°, al menos que haya una actualización en segundo plano o que Defender este chequeando el PC.  Sin embargo, para mantener estas temperaturas se debe tener una base o almuhadilla refrigerante. Para las tareas diarias, es mas que suficiente; con la APP Armory Create (es una excelente APP de Asus para gestionar el poder del PC), puedes activar el modo eco de la GPU cuando no necesites tareas exigentes, esto desactiva la tarjeta grafica dedicada y el PC se mantiene muy fresco para trabajo suave con temperaturas entre los 45 - 50° sin necesidad de base refrigerante, trabajando además de forma muy silenciosa lo que se agradece en la oficina o en la Universidad. La calidad de la camara no es muy buena, pero realmente casi no la uso.

Read for a few important details...,"UPDATE: For anyone who doubted that the mobo in the 2022 version of this laptop supported Gen 4 SSD's, you can put those doubts to rest. I received, installed and tested the 1tb Gen 4 Micron 3400 series SSD that I ordered. The drive is rated to achieve 6600 read and 5000 write.  Chrystal Disk tests mine out at 6545.55 read and 4934.03 write.  The only way that I could realize the top speeds of my new Micron Gen 4 SSD is if the Mobo supported Gen 4 SSD's.  So there you have it. Just be aware that a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo will run hotter than a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo.  To make matters a bit worse, there isnt a lot of room inside this laptop for air flow.  This may be why the manufacturer of the 2022 version used a Gen 3 SSD instead of a Gen 4 SSD.  This is by no means an insurmountable problem.  Just make sure that you shop for a decent M.2 SSD heat sink at the same time that you're shopping for that new ultra fast Gen 4 SSD. Ive used a 1mm thick graphene coated copper plate, on top of a 1mm thick silicone pad on top of a 0.07mm thick layer of graphene tape.  This may be overkill but I dont want to waste even a single, brief worry on how hot my drive might be getting lol!  I see the price of the laptop went up a bit.

I've got a self-built desktop that uses numerous ASUS components, and have used their laptops in the past (my family business also bought a couple Vivobooks). The designs are usually top notch & well built. This one has a solid LCD housing without too-much flex. The battery life is reasonable for this system; the ""silent"" mode keeps things quiet & cool for non-gaming and non-video/audio production tasks. ""Performance"" mode (predictably) runs the battery down quickly but this mode is best used when connected to a power outlet. The fans are a little loud under heavy loads, but that's also to be expected in such a slim chassis. The speakers are competent but not stellar. The display has a great refresh rate & good viewing angles. I think the i7-12650H model was the right choice as it still gives you all 6 Performance Cores compared to the 12700H, you're losing 4 E-cores but as a mostly stationary/occasionally portable gaming system it's not really a loss. The TB4 & multiple USB ports (that don't block each other by being too close) are all USB 3 & up, no USB 2 here. My model has an SK Hynix Gold P31 SSD (512GB) & I'm plenty happy with that performance. I'll but putting in a second NVMe drive later since the slot on the board is open.

I store my laptop safely in a case when I am not using it.) I only use it for school so none of this should be an issue. It stays at home. I haven't dropped it. It just simply sucks.

Initially, there was a problem with the screen dimming so much when I tried to work from the battery the laptop became virtually unusable.  After a 25 minute call to ASUS, the problem was fixed.  However I realized that in fixing it, I lost the battery icon and had no way to know how much battery I had left.  That necessitated a second call to ASUS.  Once we completed that call, the original problem of the screen dimming was back, so I called a third time and finally got a fix (had to go into the bios again).  Was it worth the hassle - time will tell, I've only had it two days.  As of now, it is sufficiently fast for basic office applications and for online activity.  I do not do gaming and suspect you'd want a Ryzen 5 processor or better for real gamers.  The speakers, which are located on the underneath and both sides, are just fine.  The backlit keyboard is nice.  The charging cable is really flimsy and I don't know why they would skimp there.  It feels like it is well-built and it is attractive.  If it hadn't been such a hassle, I'd be more enthusiastic. As it is, it is perfectly fine for my uses but I am still considering returning it, although I don't feel like starting the whole process over again.

Asus will respond and tell everyone who reports this issue (There are many) to uninstall and reinstall the driver. Or to send the laptop in for repair. But this low sound is a design defect. Reinstalling drivers won't do anything. And unless Asus redesigns the speaker system sending the laptop in for repairs won't fix anything because it's not broken. It's a design defect.

Many other reviews complain of sound which is very quiet but the laptop has bluetooth so I was able to just Bluetooth a speaker to it to solve that issue. I have no issue with the screen like many others have so either I’m not picky or I got lucky to get a good screen. This laptop does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty. Which I am currently in the process of using to have a faulty hinge replaced. 8gb of ram is more than enough for my online college classes but there is also space to expand this if you need to. I’m also able to run sims 4, wizard 101, and other more minor games with no issue. It can run games like fortnite but it only runs on the lowest graphics setting and gets hot fast so if you are looking to do more online popular games I would suggest a different laptop with better specs all around. I did only get the 128gb of space but to fix this I bought an external SSD with a 500gb capacity. They have different sizes which is something you should look into before buying so you know what to expect for more space. All in all it’s a perfect laptop for me. The battery life is fine for most of my school work I can normally run it from full for 1-2 hours depending on if I’m doing work or gaming. I would recommend this laptop for anyone who just needs a basic laptop for everyday use that isn’t gaming. Unfortunately if you want a laptop for a more intense gaming experience you’ll need to be looking at laptops much higher than the price of this one.",Maria,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021",3 people found this helpful

Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop.

I drew the short straw to be sure. Amazon (who was the direct seller for this unit) was particularly, and in fairness uncharacteristically unhelpful. They gave me two options to return it: either a UPS pick-up, which doesn't work in my apartment building (the UPS person won't be able to get up to my apartment) or I could pay out of my own pocket to return the defective item. I contacted Amazon consumer service to see if I could get another option (e.g., providing me a label), and the agent just kept repeating those two options over and over again. Incidentally, in the ""I'll Ship It Myself"" option, Amazon would refund me up to $3.99 for the turn. Purchasing the label to return it myself cost me almost $20. Is that a lot of money? No. But, within the context of this purchase, it was upsetting. It cemented an already poor experience.

The display is good and sharp. ///// We paid a little more to get the Ryzen 5 series processor and the machine is significantly faster than the Windows 10 computers we had before. Admittedly, this laptop is not used for gaming or dense graphic arts work in Illustrator or Photoshop... We use a powerful desktop for that. But for general business purposes, especially those requiring portability, this is a fine choice at relatively low cost.

External speakers weren't much better.  I don't know if it was an issue with the jack or the speakers or the cord.

I have found it disconcerting and annoying that we the people have allowed things to become the way they have. There is no way apparently to even get this laptop started without an email address providing your name personal information and an internet connection. All of these things lead to an invasion of my privacy. Although it seems free to allow every large company on planet Earth to know everything about everybody, it isn't free. There will be penalties there will be consequences. Science fiction has provided many scenarios, but that's why it's called fiction. The reality of the thing is that's pretty soon we will not be able to make a decision by ourselves. I've noticed that some people already cannot do anything without checking out a video first. Everything and everybody is tracked. I use my phone to check my credit card account, my bank account, the TV listings and some internet browsing. I recently installed a tracker blocker made by Duck Duck Go. The aforementioned use of my phone produces 3,000 blocked trackers every 7 days. It is disgusting and creepy. I cannot leave my house or dozens of or maybe hundreds or thousands of companies know where I am and know that I'm not home and know that there's no one at home because I'm gone. At any time you can stop by and do what you want because they know I'm not home. This laptop has language written by Microsoft that tells me how much they are helping me by allowing them to track me. And in so many words, that's not true. Many people, and it was seeing the younger generation, does not see the problem with this. I hear people say, ""everybody does it"" as if that makes it okay. It is not okay, but my laptop is more than 10 years old and I needed a new one. I can repair my old appliances and some of the old electronics. I can repair older cars, in fact my new car is 20 years old. Unlike the people on TV, I do regular maintenance and I do not have breakdowns. Everything today has programmed obsolescence. There was a time when durable goods meant 16 to 20 years. Today, durable goods last 2 to 4 years. My refrigerator is was purchased at Sears by me in 1995. It still works. My washer and dryer was also purchased in 1995 and they still work. I will be lucky to get four or five years out of this laptop. I am sure windows will be more than happy to sell another copy of their software on some company's laptop. In a time wheen people are more and more aware that the resources on planet earth are finite, we manufacture goods that will end up in a landfill.",NostraEd,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022",19 people found this helpful

The 10th Gen Core i5 processor is 2 generations old at this point, but it has plenty of power to run pretty much all modern games at a decent setting.  The Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics processor is an entry level to the new Ray-Tracing sexiness that's the next big thing in graphics.  On newer games you probably won't be able to get past the 60fps barrier at 1080p with the settings cranked, but dialing the details down a bit will give you better rates. The display is rated for 1080p and 144hz, and while it's not the brightest or most vibrant screen out there, it's fine for this price point.  There is also a (full size) HDMI out, but I have not had occasion to connect this to an external monitor yet.

It has been a nice entry level gaming laptop for my husband.  I like that this can be upgraded with the extra RAM slot and an extra SSD slot and 2.5 bay.  Something to keep in mind, this does not accept anything made by crucial. I don’t know why, but I had a crucial nvme m2 internal ssd (4x4 gaming ssd) and a crucial 2.5 ssd and both caused the laptop to stay on a black screen upon boot up.  After a lot of research, there were many forums from others saying they also ran into this problem and crucial storage is not compatible with the bios.  Would I have bought this at full price at around $1000.  No.  For the deal I got it at, yes.  If you can get this during a deal and looking for a great starter gaming laptop, this is a good choice to go with.",dvspinay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022",8 people found this helpful

The quick start manual does cover the problem of putting in the power plug. You need to follow those simple directions. The complaints about the microphone or the headphone port not working are due to the default windows 11 software settings.  You need to mess about with various settings to get them to work.  This information should be in the startup guide.  There is also a user manual that can be downloaded from Acer. The manual has some good points but needed to go into more depth. Some folks complain about the product being damaged in transit.  The box that the computer comes in is of good quality (perhaps it has been recently improved)..  The outer package (the one that Amazon provides) needs more protective foam or bubble wrap around the computer box. Some people complained in other reviews about the heat output from the computer -- it runs so hot that they needed a cooling mat. In normal operation the variable speed cooling fans ('coolboost') seem to do a good job of handling the heat. However, if you are running computer calculation intensive programs you will need to look for a cooling mat. You can easily tell when the computer is getting too hot -- the cooling fans speed up and you can feel the heat coming out of the exhaust ports. In normal operation the computer draws about 65 watts and in heavy use it is less than 100 watts. ALERT: The ""coolboost"" software works for Windows 10 but as soon as you update to Windows 11 the software stops working. I called the Acer repair service and they said that the problem will be fixed in an update but that update is not going to be available until April. The power supply is a ""stepmode"" type and that is very good if you need to run your computer ""off the grid.""  The power supply works with voltages from 100VAC to 220 VAC and from 50 to 60 cps.  The stepmode power supply can deal with the rather high total harmonic distortion (THD) produced by a standby generator.  Overall, this  17 inch computer is well worth the price (($1199).",Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2022",12 people found this helpful

I charged it up before using it and got four hours on a charge, even with all the downloads and rebooting several times, and it charged up to full again in less than an hour while I was using it, so the battery is acceptable.

Okay so I ordered this laptop for my daughter's birthday. So on day one I told her it will not turn on till you charge it so first thing she did was plugged it in and let it charge a few moments later we powered it up and my daughter was super excited so she went on to download a game she likes to play online. So the next day she goes to play the game and the screen froze shortly into the game so first thing was to wait to see if maybe it was lag but after a minute or so nothing still froze. Mouse didn't move so next I pushed alt, control, delete. Nothing so the ESC and nothing then the windows key. So I powered it down and powered back up keyboard lights up but no display so I hold the power key down for 15 seconds nothing. So I decided to power down again and power up and nothing but the keyboard powers up. So I this point I'm upset and my daughter is super bummed after being super happy and excited a moment ago .so I called costumer support and they let me know that my computer is under warranty and it can be taken care of but I get cut off and I'm running late for work so I decided I'd call back after work. So I called again and talked to costumer support again so went through the same conversation and then they said they could refund my money or replace it I optioned for a replacement they said ok but because of the price there supervisor would have to ok it I said ok so after about ten minutes on the phone the till me that there supervisor can't ok the transaction that they have to wait for the morning supervisor to do this I said fine and that I would be contacted the next day....... Well it's been so it's been 4 days and nothing I'm starting to feel scammed by Amazon for some reason.

In the recent year, they've ventured in gaming laptop and actually becomes one of the leading budget gaming laptop maker. Though I haven't been playing game for a while, I decided to pick this up after reading rave reviews about it online and I must admit that it's a very good gaming laptop and comes at a very affordable price, just shy of one grand. The red accent lighting on this laptop make it looks very intimidating but also very stealthy (black on read lettering). I like that all the ports (HDMI, USB, Type C, RJ45, etc...) are placed on the sides, and only the power adaptor port is in the back, which makes lot more sense. The 15.6"" screen is decent for some games but not ideal, however, having a smaller screen makes it more versatile and lighter to bring around. The screen has awesome graphic, super bright, colorful and sharp images. This laptop runs on the 11th gen of core i7 CPU, plus its GeForce RTX 3050 Ti makes it a beast of a gaming laptop to play Word of Warcrafts. I haven't tested it on those first person shooter game (not a fan) so I can't vouch for those games, but I'd definitely buy this again or recommend it to any of my friends (in my WoW guild).

First of all, when I came it wouldn't turn on or charge (yes the charger had clicked but still nothing). I contacted acer and they told me to send it over for check up, I couldn't because I needed it for college so I asked for a refund but it wasn't going through so I had to wait a few days to see if I could get one. The laptop ended up charging so I decided to not return it (which I regret). Soon after, (like not even a day after) this glitch would randomly appear multiple times and it was annoying. The bottom of the screen would multiply, go in up and down motions, and vibrate through the whole screen and it just wouldn't stop doing it for a few seconds/minute. Knowing that they would have just told me to send it over, I sucked it up even though it would get worse every time. Secondly, the battery life. It really does suck, it never lasts more than 2 hours even when I'm just doing assignments in Word. And when gaming it won't even last an hour. Thirdly, it's supposed to be for gaming but it lags and it's slow even when I'm just using Google or doing assignments. It literally takes so long to load, games are laggy, etc. I expected a 16 RAM, i7 processor to at least run a roblox game, but no. It lags to even that. Fourthly, the charging port broke. It started having issues to charge again, sometimes it would stop charging. Not long after, it completely stopped charging so I assumed it was the charger so I bought a new one (which was $50) just to find out the charger wasn't the issue. Now, it charges if the charger is at a specific position, move it a little and it'll stop charging.",Valeria,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022",

My conclusions are that for the price-point asked for it, which incidentally is less than what it was when it first arrived at my place, it's well worth the money. The graphics card delivers images and a gaming experience as good as machines I have that costs several hundred dollars more than this one. For me this the essential feature of a gaming laptop and this one passes that test with flying colors. My most demanding games performed without glitches, sputtering or any of the other problems that arise from inadequate graphics functionality. Speed on gaming and all other activities on this device leave nothing to complain about. The screen here provides crisp, clear images, another plus for demanding gaming in which partly hidden features during play need to be identified and engaged. Conversely, however, the sound card could be better. This card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming, though it's fine for watching movies or streaming. RAM can be upgraded though I see no need to do so at this point. The casing for this device is strong even though this machine is thinner and sleeker than my other gaming laptops, so much so that I'd feel comfortable using it in a business setting; something I would not do with my other gaming machines which look too much like they're designed for fun and games rather than a professional environment. This is a very fast and responsive piece of equipment, essential for a good gaming experience and something I would want anyway from any computer. My bottom line is that you get an exceptional bargain with this machine priced at just under $900 as of this writing in late July 2021. I'd definitely recommend it for those looking for a good gaming device capable of handling demanding play at a more affordable price.",J.

Far faster than my old one (of course) and runs every program to its max. For gaming a 3050 ti is limited to mostly 1080p gaming unless you play some of the lighter games where you can eek out 144op, but you can easily get 120fps on most games with some tweaks with around 70 to 90 fps on larger AAA titles. One of the first things you have to do with any Acer laptop is go into control panel and change the power settings, they come standard with USB and HDD/SSD auto power off which pretty much puts your laptop to sleep whether you change sleep settings or not. Also, press the (N) button by the num pad, click on the gear icon, and click to make the keyboard backlight stay on. I read some reviews online that said the keyboard backlight would turn off automatically, luckily my last laptop was a Acer predator and they have the same settings basically. Fans are almost non existent when just browsing and you can control them (finally) when doing some intense gaming (or using programs like CAD or the like). Also, the power cord is a dual step process, the first click means nothing, you have to push in till you hear a second click. I was looking for a 17"" inch laptop with more than 2 USB A ports, those ports NOT on the right side (mouse interference), could game at atleast 1080p/above 60 fps, a better processor, and had a ethernet port. Sounds like alot but most laptops are 15"" inch with 2 USB A ports and no ethernet ports now. I'm satisfied with this purchase.",Maurice A.

Even with 8gb Ram it seems to run smooth and work well also (though I am upgrading to 32gb). I can’t comment on the gaming bc I can’t install a real game until my ssd upgrade comes in but I’m hopeful and I’m happy thus far. It is important to note that to charge you have to push the cable in kinda hard until you hear the click sound, otherwise it doesn’t charge. It took me a few minutes to figure that out. Also, not a lot of bloatware installed so that’s good too; it’s unnecessary to use Norton when you have Windows Defender so I’d uninstall it along with Dropbox. Laptop isn’t very heavy and to keep it that way I’m opting to not use the HDD bay and instead just use m.2 ssd instead. This seems like a quality product so far so hopefully it lasts as long as my last Asus laptop did (6+yrs & still going). Wish a Blu-ray drive was included but not a deal breaker as you can buy an external slim one for around $100. Highly recommend this system so far, just know you’re going to need to upgrade the storage immediately before playing storage heavy games like WoW, COD, etc hence 4/5 stars.",Saint Trapthony,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022",One person found this helpful

I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance @ 2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably. You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit. For games like WoW open world 89-144 fps out questing. PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with medium/high settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit. But is great at 1080p seeing it’s a smaller screen resolution @ 1080p looks amazing. color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well. I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does. Honestly I think it’s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version. The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games. but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss. I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth. You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 2.5 sata drive slot as well.

I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it, i’ll say it. This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY.  It doesn’t miss a single beat. Loads in less than 30 seconds, and that’s only with 8 gb of RAM. The screen quality is so nice too, it looks like it has an overlay almost. It starts up quickly, loads web pages super fast. I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even. I don’t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops, but if you’re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you’re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics, you will be BLOWN AWAY. The laptop is super light and thin. The keyboard has a nice feel to it, i like the back light but i wish you could change the color. I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet, and it doesn’t heat up that much at all. It does slow down a little without being hooked up, but i don’t plan on using it portably so I can’t speak to that. This was worth every penny, and I’m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price. I don’t see how it gets any better than this for little ol’ me",jazz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021",390 people found this helpful

However, the first day of having it, I've noticed that the charging indicator would flash orange nonstop after a full. I've tried calibrating the battery(No flash for 2 days), battery resetting(No flash for 10 hours), unplugging the battery(No change). None of these things would get that darn light to stop flashing. So, to remedy this issue, I've changed the battery. Low and behold, it never has flashed orange since. First thing I recommend with this laptop is change the battery ASAP for two reasons. 1. The battery life isn't very long. 2.

The Ryzen scored better in Cinebench but the Helios scored better in Heaven due to the 3060. The fan's didn't ramp up to bad in both Cinebench and Heaven but the CPU did throttle peaking at 94c. Cinebench score was 12594, Heaven, it scored a 5034 with 406 FPS max. I then ran the same tests using the turbo mode and extreme profile to see what difference it made. The CPU ran much cooler and scored better in Cinebench with a 12824, GPU stayed cooler as well, but performance for whatever reason, slipped. In Heaven I recorded a score of 4264 with 365FPS max. Thought those numbers to be a bit odd, you would think using the extreme mode it would be pulling better numbers on the GPU. I loved the keyboard on this, much more customizable then the Legion 5 was, another thing you can customize in software is the boot logo. The laptop also makes this kind of cool musical tone when you first boot it up which I've never seen before. Gonna have to find out how that is done and try doing it myself. The IPS screen looks absolutely amazing on this. Power supply is a 230 watt unit and this also comes with a carrying case of sorts that you can put it into. Like I said I compared this to my Lenovo Legion, which is priced about $200 less. All in all, it was very hard to say which is the better machine.

I''ve played Doom Eternal and I am now playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it. The games look great and run well. It's a decently solid machine. I added 2 additional hard drives to it. I did not like how the casing comes apart to add the hard drives. It felt like very delicate procedure designed to break the casing. I got it done without breaking anything, but definitely watch videos on how to do it before you try. The bios is odd, I want to figure out how to set one of the added hard drives as bootable, but the bios doesn't seem to want me to do that...says something about window boot manager?.  I would prefer the old c, d, f, g or whatever it used to be. Sometimes a guy just wants to set the boot order to 1st a non-bootable drive, then another non-bootable drive and then the bootable drive....actually I wanted to figure out if I could load win 10 on another drive and boot to it so I could run some older firewire audio hardware that doesnt support win 11. Guess that I may be too old or not motivated enough to figure it out. Speakers are tinney but ok. Good ports. Keyboard is ok. Sometimes computer is a bit wonky, locks up on weird stuff or won't boot a game, but I just restart it and everything is fine. The price was good.

I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years.  Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste.  Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......)  With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible.  I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it!  So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck!

Before then, I never owned a true gaming PC. The only computer I owned before that wasn’t a hand-me-down was a 2016 Acer Aspire E15 with an Intel i5 and a NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card with 8GB of memory. Needless to say, for any serious type of gaming, it was not to last. Games like Sonic Generations had the fan screaming in agony and the game would freeze at random points and games like Street Fighter V at lowest settings ran at about half speed. The only other modern gaming system I have was the Nintendo Switch, and while I love that system, it’s not the best main drive to play the latest blockbuster releases from 3rd Parties. And so, I began looking for a new gaming PC. I tried looking for a desktop all summer but I could never afford or find the parts I wanted and the prebuilt options didn’t impress me. But in September of this year I found this little guy and it had everything looking for it.

The battery obiously not meant for gaming on the go, even if it is a laptop. BUT people have complained about the fans and yes it is loud asf. If you wanna use it for school or basic stuff you can go into battery mode, go into control panel -> hardware and sound -> power options -> change plan settings -> advanced power settings -> configure intel thermal whatever tf -> lower it to 35 -> and PCI express max power savings -> processor power management -> decrease cpu speed before increasing fan.  That way it will be quiet while you do non-power needing things like word or take notes at school.

After further research, I decided to spend the extra few hundred dollars on this laptop. Out of the box, downloaded games such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege and all work excellent. I bought a hard wire for the internet thinking I would need it to prevent lag for gaming, but have not once needed to connect the cable and the cable is still in its box....................ONE THING: I do want to point out is that this laptop will get HOT fast for gaming. It does have the turbo fan, which is much needed, and the turbo helps cool down the laptop, but the turbo feature is loud. I just recently ordered a fan pad and still waiting for that to come in. The only suggestion is if you order this laptop (GREAT LAPTOP AND FAST) I would suggest ordering a cooling pad also. This way you can have it cooled down maybe more quietly without having to run the Turbo fan on the laptop. I have no regrets ordering this laptop. VERY, VERY PLEASED with its performance and would recommend to anyone looking to game. I bought the 512Gb for the extra space. I hope this laptop lasts me a while cause it is AWESOME!!!",Cole,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2020",10 people found this helpful

It's great for gaming if you want this laptop to never last then go ahead let it push and die in a year.

This is with a cooling pad, and the fan running at turbo and some how managed to hit tjmax. The build is decent and has seen some abuse such as accidentally dropping it a few times and never noticing any substantial drop in performance. On the other hand, too bad it'll drop in performance anyways when the interior gets so hot that it needs turbo on all the time as the cpu gets so hot that it lowers the clock speed to save itself. Also, The predator button is the stupidest design choice i've ever seen and the program itself manages to take 20% of cpu load and make the laptop hotter by having the program running by itself. I don't care if I can change the predator button's settings, as having it where the num lock is annoying and shows how much acer cared about keyboard design when they first made this.",wat,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022",

The SSD boots right up very quick load times, the GTX card is very capable for almost all gaming needs. I have been playing COD Warzone and it runs extremely smooth, the fans do get loud and after a while they REALLY start pushing hot air out the side to where you can feel it on your mouse hand if youre close enough, I think this is a good indicator of how well its cooling. The one issue that lots of reviewers mentioned and its very true, is that the battery life is abysmal, I can play COD for about an hour unplugged, even just sitting there on the homescreen it will only last maybe 3 hours. i get it with all these powerful features it does use a lot of power, but if you think youll have enough battery for a 4 hour flight this isnt it. BUT with how incredibly well it runs my games, i can forgive it i still give it 5 stars even with the terrible battery life because this is clearly a gaming laptop and it doesnt pretend to be anything else. The custom LED lighting for the keyboard is pretty slick, you can give it different light profiles for different games. The monitor is really impressive for a laptop, even high movement gaming looks fantastic with no perceptible lag. The wireless card is very fast i get about 85-90% wired speeds even with a few walls between the router. Overall im very impressed and I absolutely recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great gaming rig. Also, its upgradable, it comes with a hard drive expansion kit, and everything can be taken out and upgraded for future proofing.",Jason H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020",6 people found this helpful

I tried to make the best of the preloaded operating system with the stuff that was on there, but I did not like it. I downloaded the Windows 10 creation tool and put that on a USB. I booted to USB and did a clean install of Windows 10 home. Afterward I started utilizing this little beast to play call of duty. Let me tell you, I have never in my life seen a laptop get this hot! When I say hot I mean it will burn your freaking fingers! The panel center of the screen above the keyboard was so hot I could have literally fried a piece of meat on it! I'm not kidding! Luckily for me I had a five fan laptop cooling device that I plug into my USB and was able to put it underneath my laptop which yielded impressive cooling to this machine. Let me tell you it is still hot! But not so hot that it would burn you now. I am very worried that the heat that is generated from this machine will make it die too soon. Otherwise I am averaging a hundred and sixty three frames per second on call of duty world war II, I do not have the settings to max on anything because I want performance more than I want beautiful pictures.

What convinced me to return and not purchase another Helios 300 are the number of people on the Acer support forums that have experienced similar issues without resolution.

Keyboard: The keyboard works fairly well for gaming, though most purists will likely use an external one anyway.

A lot of my gaming is Warframe which this handles beautifully, but to put this laptop through its paces I also ran Doom Eternal, Borderlands 3, and Quake Champions. They're as smooth as butter. Compared to other gaming laptops I appreciate the slim form factor and the weight. It seems like Acer really tried to keep this as compact as possible while keeping the 15.6"" screen. I do have a few minor gripes. I wish the built-in management software had more configurable options for the keyboard backlight, but it does have lots of other things you can tweak that other management software like HP's currently doesn't like customize your boot-up image and fan speeds. The laptop also comes with a little bit of bloatware, but I always appreciate an 25gb boost to my Dropbox for another year.

After receiving it and using it for a few days, I am speechless.  Is it perfect?  No, the speakers aren't that great and the battery doesn't last that long. But it is FAST and has just about every feature you would want on a high end gaming laptop.  It has the latest 12th generation 14-core Intel i9-12900H CPU, it has the latest Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU, it has 32GB of the latest DDR5 RAM, and it has an extremely fast 1TB SSD drive.  The monitor is very bright and clear.  The resolution is even greater than a QHD monitor.  QHD is 2,560 X 1,440; but this monitor is 2,560 X 1,600.  This means you have more vertical space, which is great for both gaming or if you have several windows open at the same time.  The build quality is almost as good as an Apple MacBook Pro laptop.  The most impressive feature is the price.  This model currently sells for $3,000.  If you configure an Alienware or Razer laptop with the same specs as this Acer, you're going to pay over $1,000 more.  So this is not only one of the best laptops on the market, but it's the bargain of the year in gaming laptops.  Whether you're a gamer or you just need a high-end machine for your daily work, the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE should be on your short list of models to consider.",Ernest Stalnaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2022",

The heft and performance mean business, though the loud startup sound and fireworks display on the keyboard betrays a bit more whimsy.  It can fill both niches nicely, as can it be a portable desktop replacement.  I say portable, but  at a very dense 5lbs (feels much heavier) and with a 4 hour battery life, it's not a typical laptop.  Between the low base CPU speed and the various max Q tricks used by the GPU, it can and does make sacrifices to allow for this portability.  Most evident is the 230watt power pack, which is ridiculous for a laptop, but the GPU alone could draw more on the desktop, but upgradability is another issue.",ReverendOlaf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020",200 people found this helpful

The highest it's been was 90 degrees celsius. If you plan to get this laptop I would suggest you get a laptop cooler. It helps and now the temperatures don't go higher than 80 degrees celsius. It was advertised for 11-hours of battery life but when I tested it, the battery held up to 9 hours of use which is pretty decent for a laptop. Be aware that the GPU RTX 3050ti uses 40 watts of battery, which is a lot. So if you plan to game, the battery would last for 3-5 hours. Its performance has been remarkable and I suggest this laptop for students and people who want to do a little gaming. It did disappoint that it was a 60-hertz display. The computer is powerful so I hoped it had a 144 or 240hz display. Either way, this is a good laptop and if you are a gamer get a monitor that has a high refresh rate because I easily had 100fps+ on Valorant and Fortnite.

I am unsure if the ram or solid state drive is set or if you can upgrade them. I did not try to open or upgrade the item. These are the two things you should research before purchasing this. Although with the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do that. This Acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy. It has a decent processor (ryzen 7). The ram is 16 gb which is well beyond the suggested nowadays. It will definitely work for most daily usage as well as design and gaming. That being said, it is not the best in terms of battery life. It really only last about three to four hours at most on a full charge. The fan is a bit loud on heavy usage. It is a standard AC charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future if needed. The power brick is okay but does get hot while charging. You will need it plugged in to really game on this device. Upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. The bloatware is not too terrible. The laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. It still keep the traditional two USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. I am not a fan of typing on them as it just feels a bit on the cheaper end. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it. The dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and I have not had any issues with any sound issues. It usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. The laptop itself can last about five to six hours or so on a full charge. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually have less than that. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so I would recommend you uninstall that if possible. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. The 3060 TI runs great! It is a very powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer although the screen is only 14 inches. The fan also is a bit loud on high usage (gaming). The processor is an Ryzen 7 which is MORE than enough power for what I need it to do on a daily. In terms of video games, it can play many games at very high quality although you do need to have it plugged in. The processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what I need. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a a very powerful laptop. You get a smaller screen but the gaming on it is not bad.  The acer laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is not the best. The specification is not bad at 16 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what I need it for but for gaming it will fill up fast. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work, gaming, or basic computer with a single monitor connection.",Xephz82,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021",One person found this helpful

I recommend getting a 65W usb-c charger instead of using the charger it comes with. The one it comes with is a little flimsy and I feel like it’ll break with extended use.

The laptop itself meets the standards, and surpasses some of the concerns. The pluses include, small size, dedicated graphics, AMD and NVIDIA together, and moderate level internals. Some of the initial concerns were the display, which was said to be limiting and have issue with the color accuracy. With the laptop in hand, I would agree that the display isn't on par with some of the higher end laptops, but it fits my needs and is sufficient for browsing, gaming, or video playback. Another said concern was that the audio was lacking as well. My first hand experience leads me to agree with that statement, as the audio below 50 in the settings is hardly audible, meaning that the max audio is also lower that most competitor laptops. However, my solution was to wear headphones, as it works perfectly fine with them. Finally, the battery life was advertised to be 17 hours, which is obviously exaggerated given this laptop has a dedicated graphics card, but it seems to fall  shorter than expected. When the laptop puts to use the GPU, RTX 3050 ti, the battery life drops significantly to at most, 3 hours, at worst, 1 and a half. While normally browsing and video playback, the battery life lasts at most 13 hours on battery saver and 7 on the median battery options.",Talia I.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2021",2 people found this helpful

After exhaustive research and comparisons over a couple of months I decided the swift x was exactly at the price/performance intersection for me. It's a little thicker and heavier than I prefer for travel but given the massive performance it has over my old Yoga laptop I consider it a reasonable trade. The 16:10 display is not my preferred aspect ratio for lightroom and photoshop but I use a calibrated 4k external monitor for serious work sessions. The built in display has great gamut and color space specs and sharp details for a 1080 panel. Battery life is excellent if you're not flogging it. The fan ran an obnoxious amount out of the box, even at idle but a quick Google showed it was a known issue and a quick settings change quieted things right down. I haven't done much video work on it yet but I have some upcoming projects that will put the GPU to the test. It rips through lightroom and photoshop tasks with ease. It nips at the heels of my friend's top of the line Razer at a fraction of the price, and that's an Intel machine.

The cons,aka thing I don't care for. The power adapter for this Acer Swift is very small and delicate,  the Ram is soldered on so if the Ram gives you issues its not as easy as popping in a new stick, it comes with more bloat ware apps installed than my last OEM laptop and lack of any additional inputs, besides the 2 USB, 1 USB c HDMI, and a headset port.

This does not fold into a tablet. Before I ordered this, I watched several video reviews on the internet for the Inspiron 14 7420. It was great that it became a tablet. Well, buyer beware, because I watched videos for the 7420 2-in-1 which is a different model. Why would Dell name two very different products with the same name and model number? Anyway, the description is exactly what I got. I should have done more homework. Anyway, that has nothing to do with 3 out of 5 stars. This is a ""good"" laptop. Small with a nice, compact power brick. The battery is good when new. I like the fingerprint reader built into the power button. The trackpad has worked really well over the last couple days (I know others had issues). The keyboard is adequate - better than most in this ultra-thin style but not as good as the old laptop keyboards when they had built-in CD drives. Why 3/5 stars? The speed is comparable to my old Windows 8 computer that I upgraded to Windows 10. And there is a feeling of bloatware - hesitation when a program is taxed to open a new feature, for example. What to say that this is an i7? THIS SHOULD RUN MUCH FASTER. NO joke - I set up a Celeron J4125 mini-PC yesterday that cost $200 and it runs faster than this thing. I also have a 1-year old, low-end Alienware gaming PC that cost less than this and it is lightspeed faster. I don't understand how this could get good reviews all over the Internet. For everything I see, it should cost around $600, the specs be damned. At this price, at least I would expect a 17"" screen like my Alienware which cost less.",Ryan K.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022",One person found this helpful

Even though the XPS is still Dell’s true flagship laptop, this Inspiron 14 plus offers basically everything you could want in a modern ultrabook apart from dedicated graphics. I reviewed the standard 14 inch model and even though these are roughy the same size, this Plus model is quite a bit heavier due to the more robust cooling system required for the 45 watt Core i7(12700H).

It does also have replaceable memory so if you want to upgrade to dual channel you can. Now if you don't run it at at full brightness and settings you can get a pretty decent battery life out of it. So for average school work and for having work papers this is a great laptop. With the benefit of being able to play some games.,"Jeef, the reef",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2022",5 people found this helpful

IMO, that makes it almost unusable in real life. Set the power mode to performance, and it becomes a great media consumption, email, social, writing machine with a good 6 hrs of battery.

I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD.  That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream! In addition - 3583 comes spec'd with Win 10 Home (not S mode). S mode sucks and the time it takes to dump it is a pain. 2cts.",John W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2021",38 people found this helpful

We tried all of the tips on Lenovo's help forum to no avail.  Upon scanning the QR code, we discovered we were already three months into the warranty.  So we returned it for an exchange.  When the new one came today we scanned the code again.  This one as well was a couple of months into warranty.  So, we hunted around on their website and found an article that they base the warranty start date on when a supplier purchases the machine and add a single month.  I have tried several times to update the warranty via their ticket process yet, every time I go to actually submit the ticket, it's freezing and not going through.  This one so far at least seems to work.  However, they should include information on the warranty with the device.

Using chrome:\\system I confirmed they are running the same CPU, the same amount of memory (8GB), and the same platform (Volteer) . Although there doesn't seem to be much hardware difference, their performance is noticeably different. The 64GB unit's Linux virtual machine is completely tying up the CPU, while it is using a very small percent of CPU resources/time on the 128GB unit. On the 64GB unit, 10 tabs in Chrome is all it takes to see significant lag when switching between tabs, and sometimes the mouse lags and jumps around the screen. I only saw this behavior on the 128GB unit after opening something like 40 tabs, and even then it wasn't as bad. The other extremely noticeable difference is that the 64GB unit can only drive an external 1920 x 1080 display at 30Hz interlaced, resulting in obvious motion blur while scrolling on websites, while the 128GB unit can drive the same display at full 60Hz with no observable motion blur.

I’ve been looking for awhile for a good gaming laptop. I’ve looked through Razer, Asus, Gigabyte mostly the big brands then I saw this Lenovo Legion and I thought to myself why I’m I looking at those high end gaming laptops when it’s my first gaming laptop and Knowing that I would probably just toss it around and it’ll just get wreck in my backpack and stuff. So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It’s super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCafé so I didn’t do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn’t know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn’t scream I’m a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It’s all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don’t worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you’re on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you. For a thousand bucks you get an AMD Ryzen, RTX series, SSD, dual channel RAM, IPS fast monitor, Mux switch, windows 11, 3 months xbl ultimate sheesh can’t beat that.",Grimmjow,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2022",22 people found this helpful

But that was the base model with a worse graphics card, screen, refresh rate, ext. I don’t remember well anymore because I got it almost two months ago but there was 5 or 6 higher end features that would have cost nearly $2000 if I had gotten it directly from Lenovo. The battery life is poor and it can’t go more than two hours of use without being plugged in, and in video games it performs significantly worse unplugged than plugged in. But putting that annoyance aside the machine works great and is a beast at running games. I’ve yet to get a game that it wouldn’t run over 60fps and it runs warzone on max graphics at around 115-125 frames. I’m not being paid to say this so you can trust my review if you’ve read this far.

I did so, and while it most of the time works perfectly, there are intermittent times the screen goes blurry when the cursor interacts with something on the screen as well as the screen ""glitching out"" during this time.  I've had to restart a couple of times when it was like this and another time it simply stopped and began working again correctly.  I will be monitoring this and if need be, revert back to Windows 10.  Still, all in all a very solid, well working machine.",Dennis Hoover,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022",

And so, I purchased the i7 32GB RAM 2TB option. Having the ability to fold and rotate the screen to portrait mode really helped with certain types of data displays— that was great! That it was equipped with a somewhat dated i7 processor wasn’t a serious performance issue, as having a fast SSD and lots of RAM makes up for the somewhat slower/older i7 CPU that this is equipped with. However, the Surface Studio Laptop just lasted 4 months before the display failed suddenly and completely while on a work trip from the US to the UK. It seems that, while rare, hardware failures can happen with any computer. On a related note, I had a hardware failure with the SP4 when it was fairly new, and that was sorted quickly by Microsoft. And so, I had high hopes for a solution while I was traveling internationally for work.",JackOfAllTrades,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2022",One person found this helpful

For gaming computers, many consumers only know about Alienware from Dell. In fact, Asus has used the brand name Republic of Gamers since 2006 for gaming hardware. Asus makes excellent computer products. This one is no exception. When opening the box, I was surprised by its elegant design immediately. It has shining colorful stripes across the screen lid. There are many air vents on the bottom, sides, and back. There are also many legs at the bottom, so there is an air gap between the bottom surface and the table. These designs make many pointy areas on the case, but they are for heat dissipation. Nowadays, not many laptops have a built-in network port, but this laptop has one because gamers prefer wire to prevent delays. The power button is a fingerprint scanner. Uses can unlock the screen with a light touch on the power button. The 15.6” 2K screen looks bright and clear. The keyboard is backlit with colorful LEDs. It’s a cool feature.

I’ve only used it for 4 months and it has had constant problems with battery life and charging. For the price of this laptop, I should be 3k richer with a different laptop and they still won’t take my warranty on razer. Take the asus Zephyrus instead of this garbage.",Chandra Pranav,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2022",One person found this helpful

My job is mostly travel based so I needed a laptop that would fit in a business environment (to non-computer savvy people it looks just like a black version of the MacBook Pro minus the razer logo which can be covered up by a matte black dbrand skin and the rgb keyboard which I just set to white) as well as allow me to play my games when I’m away from home.,Read,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 13, 2021",27 people found this helpful

For small gaming laptop amazing performance, low fan noise around 40-45db, and very decent temperature and amazing battery life in such compact package! I managed to get even 14 hours and 35 minutes on full hd 60 hz, 30% brightness from it which is very impressive for gaming laptop for this size.

Amazon also handled it terribly and did not answer any of my requests for a replacement. Instead forcing me to try and contact useless tech support who will never be able to fix the issue.
