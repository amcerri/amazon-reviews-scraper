# Amazon Reviews Web Scraper

This is a web crawler that scrapes Amazon reviews for a given product category, or a list of specific products. The program is written in Python and uses the Scrapy framework.

The motivation for this project came from my decision to use aspect-based sentiment analysis in my final assessment while taking a course in Natural Language Processing. Instead of getting a ready-made dataset from the internet, I opted to use web scraping to generate my dataset.

# How to install and run the program

## Python and Jupyter Notebook

To run the project, you must have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You must also have Jupyter Notebook installed. You find the installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

The installation of required dependencies is done using the `requirements.txt` file, which is already included in the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook. You can uncomment the `!pip install` line and run the cell to install the dependencies.

I've used it on Visual Studio Code, but you can use whatever you are used to or comfortable with.

## Running the program

The only file you need to open in order to run the program is [amazon_reviews_scraper.ipynb](amcerri/amazon-reviews-scraper/blob/main/amazon_web_scraping/web_scraping.ipynb). This is a Jupyter Notebook file, which you can open with Jupyter Notebook. 

All the instructions are included in the notebook.
